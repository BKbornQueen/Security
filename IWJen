**layers of cyberspace** - physical network layer, logical network layer, cyber-persona layer.
      physical - hardware / infrastructure
      logical - things with intrinsic value that only exists in that layer. Software / firmware etc.
      cyber persona - identity of an actor in cyberspace. login etc.

  informational aspects are the sensory inputs (content, medium, format and context) of activities that a receiver interprets and uses to assign meaning.

## physical aspects of the informational environment 
- material characteristics, both natural and manufactured, of the environment that may inhibit or enhance communication. physical aspects may create constraints and freedoms

Space Ops
the cornerston repsonsibilities of mikiatry space forces are to presrve freeedom of action enable joint lethality and effectiveness and provide natioanal leadership with independent military operations (gPS

## OPSEC
- assess the risk to preserving essential secrecy by identifying the crucial information and indicators that must be protected, asses the vulnerabilities to adversary collection and interpretation, and identify possible OPSEC countermeasures to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Special technical operations STO

DAY 1

Introduction to Joint Multi-Domain Operations ( Joint All-Domain Operations)
5 mulit- operational domains
space- satelites great than 100 km above the mean sea level
air- 
land-
sea
cyber- is a global domain within the information environment consisting of an interdependent network of information technology infrastructers and resident data, including the internet, telecommu
Layers of cyber space
      physical network hardware
      logical network intangible
      cyber persona people
access can be gained through any combination of wired optical or wireless means
while some accesse can be achieved through assigned permissions and other means legitimate or fraudulent, access to closed networks and other ssystems
that are virtually isolated may require physical proximity or more complex , time consuming processes.

Explain the Joint all domain operations concept
JADO
The intergrated planning and employment of Joint and Interagency information capabilities, resources, and 
actiivites that enhance the single battle concept and provide defensiv offensive exploitative effects and support in order to operater finag and win through consistent.....

JDAC2 the warfighting capability to sense make sense and act at all levels and phases of war across all domains and with partners to deliver
information advantage at the speed of relevance

multi domain effects batallion

EABO a form of expeditionary warfare that involves the employment of movile low signature persistent and relatively easy to maintain and sustain naval expeditionary forces
persistitence- key maritime terrain
low signature- physical and EMS

JOINT OPERATIONS
collaboration to accomplish commanders intent

Joint Force Structure

Why a Joint Force? After WWII
incapable of coordinating land, sea and air activities across its two military departements (WAR and NVAY)


1942 President Roosevelt Created Joint Chiefs of Staffs (JCS)

During and after WWII, numermous effort
national security of 1947
      created the national military establishment a precursor to dod
perescrivbe a weak secdef
gave legal standing to the jcs but no chairman
continued to empower the military Department Secretaaris as memober of bothe the Cabinet and the ne National Security Council NCS
service domination also contiuned to trump the authority of the nified commanders in the field


Legislated revisons to the National Seecrutity act in 1949 1953 1958 attemoted to mend the defencies particullary by
Strenething the SECDEF
Establishing the Chairman of the JCS
Removing military secretaries and Service Chiefs from operational chain of command
giving unifie commanders full operational comamdn of 

defacto....
services retain defact operational control

Goldwater-nichols act 1986** - added chairman of the joint chiefs of staff sole advisor to POTUS and NSC
mandated development and implementation joint doctrine- training, planning, operations
clearly defind AORs and Combatant and Command roles
- extensive congressional hearings,, major senate inquiry, bi-partisan openness to rectify the situation, a presidential commision, and the appointment of a reform minded CJCS, admin william crowe in october 1985.
- services responsible to train, man, equip and maintain and present forces- no operational control.
- CCMD AORs and functions defined, exercise of COCOM of assigned forces.
CJCS removed from Operational control

COMMAND and Control

 supported commander
 - has the authority to exercise general direction of supporting effort.
 - designation and prioritization of missions, targets, or objectives.
 - timing and duration of supporting action.
 - other actions for coordinaton and efficiency.

## supporting commander
- determines forces, tactics, methods, procedures, and communications for employment. includeds internal task organization
- responsible to ascertain needs.
- fulfill needs.
- maintains normal command relationship with subordinate forces unless establishing directive changes it.

aggregate of social, cultural, psychological, technical, and physical factors that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from,
act upon, and are impacted by information, including the individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or use information.
- informational aspects: the way that individuals, information systems, and groups communicate and exchange information
- physical aspects: the material charactersistics, both natural and manufactured, of the environment that may inhibit or enhance communication.
- human aspects: the interactions among and between people and the enivornment that shape human behavior and decision making.

Resources in this environment include information itself and the materials and systems employed to process store display disseminate and potect information

## informational aspect of the information environment
- informational aspects reflect the way that individuals, information systems, and groups communicate and exchange information.
  informational aspects are the sensory inputs (content, medium, format and context) of activities that a receiver interprets and uses to assign meaning.

## physical aspects of the informational environment 
- material characteristics, both natural and manufactured, of the environment that may inhibit or enhance communication. physical aspects may create constraints and freedoms

joint warfighthing concept was developed to address the joint forces need to adapt to the chiangeing character of war and geopolitical landscape which requires an integrated and interoperable , multi-domain capabale, joint and coalition force to demonstrate credible deterrence

The ems as the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation is fundamental component of the natural environment and the electromagnetic operatioanl enivron emoe is a space in which military functions are performed
not a separte domain of the military


EW Subdivisions
the electromagnetic environment eme is the ems portion of the information environment where military operations are executed. The recognized need for military forces to have unimpeded access to, and use of, the eme creates vulnerabilities and opportunities for ew in support of military operations

the ability to conduct operation that access exploit and defend space rests on simultaneow action across all domoains but requires consideration of the space domains unique physcial network and cognitive dimenseions

threats in space
nation state threat potentially most dangerous due to resource access personnel and time
nostate formal and informal orgs not bound by natiaonal borders may be used by nation states or transnational actors to conduct attacks
individiual or small group threat- individual actors or small group threat can illegally disrupt or gain access to systems or facilites- may be used by nation states or transnational actorrs
man maed and natural hazord intentional or naturnarl dirsup for human error or incident

Space mission assurance
      defensive orperations, reconstituition     , resilience , and deterrence

cyberspace operations use linkas and nodes located in the physical domain and perform logical functions to create effects first in cyberspace and then as needed in the phycial domain
